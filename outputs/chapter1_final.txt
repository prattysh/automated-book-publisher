**The Gates of Morning**
**Book 1: Chapter 1**

Dick stood on the coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the waves of the outer sea crashed against the shore, while before him lay an endless expanse of calm, blue water â€“ the lagoon of Karolin.

As he gazed out at the tranquil scene, Dick's thoughts turned to the tribe that called this place home. His eyes scanned the beach, where women, children, and youths were engaged in their daily activities. He was their chief, sent by the gods to lead them.

Suddenly, his gaze shifted northward, toward the breakers of the outer sea. His mind began to wander back to Palm Tree Island, where he had grown up with Katafa, a girl who had been blown away from Karolin years ago. The memories of those turbulent times and the destruction that followed still lingered in his mind.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi, approached Dick, curiosity written across his face. "Who are you?" the child asked, his eyes wide with wonder.

Dick hesitated, unsure how to respond. His past was shrouded in mystery, and he had long forgotten his true identity. But for now, he was simply a man without a name, struggling to come to terms with his new life in Karolin.

As he pondered the child's question, Dick's gaze drifted back to the north, where Palm Tree Island lay hidden from view. He knew that one day, the men who had taken over that island would build canoes and set their sights on Karolin. The threat was real, and it weighed heavily on his mind.

Just then, Katafa appeared beside him, her dark hair blowing gently in the breeze. She pointed toward the southern sky, where Palm Tree Island was beginning to materialize through a mirage. Dick's eyes followed hers, and together they gazed out at the vision of their former home, now threatened by the very people who had once been their neighbors.

As they stood there, lost in thought, the sound of a canoe approaching broke the silence. It was the vessel that Dick had sent to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata â€“ three old men skilled in the art of canoe-building. Together, they would work to prepare for the inevitable threat that lay ahead.

Dick's thoughts were consumed by the danger that lurked beyond the horizon. He knew that it was not just the savages from Palm Tree who posed a threat but also the wolves of civilization â€“ men driven by greed, desire, and hatred.
